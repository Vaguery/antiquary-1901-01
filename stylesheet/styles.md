- `{:.first-word}` The first word of some articles is sometimes set in small caps. Mark it up as `**bold**` with double asterisks, and follow it immediately with `{:.first-word}`: `**Like**{:.first-word} this`
- `{:.scaps}` Is a placeholder introduced by the post-processing OCR scripts, just to mark locations the OCR software has managed to perceive small caps type in the original document. It should be replaced with a more appropriate semantic style definition.
