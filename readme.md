# The January 1901 issue of _The Antiquary_ magazine

## A simple experiment in Github-based editing of digitized texts

The files in this repository are page scans I've made of a 1901 issue of _The Antiquary_ magazine, and accompanying transcriptions of the text on each page. 

The _initial_ transcription was machine-generated OCR code, filtered and cleaned up slightly by some scripts I'm working on. As you know, OCR algorithms are only about 99% accurate---on a per-character level, tested on 12-point laser-printed Times Roman on modern bright white paper. Old books and magazines can be read quite well sometimes, but every material artifact has its own quirks that interfere more or less with that accuracy: unusual typefaces, unexpected typesetting conventions, complex page layouts, marginalia, foxing, library stamps, &c &c

One goal therefore is to **fix the text**. But it's not the *only* one. Another is to explore the ways digitized texts can be annotated, reused, and expanded. And of course it's all an experiment in Github's potential for collaboration in publishing and the digital humanities.

## Starting point

For the purposes of the experiment, only cursory visual checks of the OCR text were made. Whole blocks may have been skipped by the algorithm, or undesirable text added (I've seen this most often where stray marks, tears, foxing or complex illustrations are "recognized" by the software).

The magazine issue is 32 pages long. There are 32 low-resolution image files in `img/screen`, and the corresponding markdown transcriptions are in `txt/`.

As convenience scripts arise, they'll appear in `lib/`.

## End point(s) and goals

I'd like to end up with a number of things:

1. a clean, correct HTML edition of the whole
2. the ability to render HTML or other formats---because Markdown
3. a suite of convenient scripts that can support this sort of effort on participants' own local systems, rather than a centralized "work hub"
4. a "style sheet" consisting of some semantic markup and some reasonable guidelines, suitable for working on more issues of the same magazine---or old books more generally
5. a self-contained system for making the book into a _server_ of its own content

## What to do

You can always [open an issue](https://github.com/Vaguery/antiquary-1901-01/issues) or send an email for general questions or broad ideas.

If you'd like to contribute (rather than just having a copy of your own), you can use the standard Github [fork-branch-pull request cycle](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo):

- fork the project on Github
- find one or more things to improve in the markdown files, and fix them using [kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html), invoking any project-specific styles that are listed in the `stylesheets` directory
- upload your changed version to your fork on Github, placing it in a branch
- submit a pull request; taking a moment to explain the general changes you've made, to simplify reintegration

### Communicating

One of the interesting things about this scale of project is the relatively high chance of stepping on one anothers' toes. Not just by working on the same material, but by independently reinventing the same functionality in different ways.

Not sure how we'll deal with this best, especially on such a small project. Thoughts are welcomed.

### Guidelines

- Try to leave the line endings more or less the way they appear in the original text, except
  - *close up hyphenated words*: the initial scripts I've run have made most of these into "optional hyphen" ¬ characters, which _may not all_ need to be removed. There's no way to thoughtfully close up `Numer¬ous` but not `willy¬nilly`, for example.
  - *check hyphens, en- and em-dashes*: the scripts have also replaced OCR's en- and em-dashes with kramdown's character strings, but as with everything else they may not have been recognized correctly. An en-dash is represented with two hyphens (`--`), and an em-dash three (`---`).
  - *close up punctuation*: Some older printers set extra whitespace around quotes, semicolons and colons. And of course the OCR is inherently dumb. Even if the original page has extra space, modernize the spacing around punctuation marks---including em-dashes.
- *semantic markup trumps visual*: If this particular magazine uses small caps for the intial word of an article, it should be marked up not as "small caps", but as some sort of "initial word" style.
- feel free to launch branches with annotations, notes, variations, explanatory text... whatever you like.
- the individual markdown files will end up being stitched together to build the whole document; remember that blank lines start new paragraphs in markdown, so what I'll be doing is removing the last lines of every page, and assuming a blank line _starting_ a page opens a new paragraph
- `kramdown` will handle inserting typographic quotations more-or-less correctly (as well as all the dashes and stuff), but it can't recognize apostrophe-starting contractions like ’tis or ’twas. Type the correctly-curled quote yourself in these instances (if any).
- ask questions and open issues!

## Some notes towards a style guide

- book and magazine titles should be italicized (with asterisks or underscores) and styled `{:.book-title}`, even when they are set in small caps in the work; the small caps decoration appears within blocks labeled `{:.review-abstract}` and can be separately decorated if needed
- bring people's names up onto one line, including their degrees or affiliations
- all thought breaks and horizontal rules are set, for now, as `* * *`
- add en-dashes in ranges, even if they don't appear in the original page
- no idea how to make the heading and title levels consistent yet; sometimes I use `##`, sometimes `###`
- indicate approximate illustration locations in HTML comments `<-- like this -->`
- `A.D.` should be set close (like that) and will eventually be styled as small caps
- some book titles, with extensive subtitles, are decorated only partially; this may be fixed or not, as you see fit. For example. `*The Book of John Fisher*{:.book-title}, Town Clerk and Deputy Recorder of Warwick (1580--1588)` appears to be an entire title, but only the first portion was set in small caps in the original review abstract. Open question.
- several inline headers are used in the endmatter, especially on page 32; separate the header as such (`Erratum` or `Note to Publishers`) and we will use CSS to inline it with the em-dash (which should also be removed)

## What doesn't work

There's no support yet for

- rendering the markdown into a single stitched-together HTML file
- high-resolution illustrations
- Github will try to render the markdown files (when you view them on-site) using [Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), not kramdown; that's the way it'll be, I guess. Remember to view the raw files to see the edits rather than the mis-rendered versions.
