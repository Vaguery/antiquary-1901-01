years or more Town Clerk of Warwick, several
times M.P. for the borough, and at the time of the
beginning of the record, Bailiff of Warwick. The
"Book" illuminates at many points the social life
of the sixteenth century. It shows the punishments
meted out to all sorts of offenders. Some
charges are marked "dischargid," or "let goo";
many "whippid and let goo." Two pedlars, having
nefarious dealings with a "petycote" are "committid
to the gaole as Roges." The details of the
various examinations of culprits are often most
interesting, and show how vagrants and thieves
and rascals of various kinds from all parts of the
country passed through the Bailiff's hands in eight
years. The Bailiff himself directly cross-examined
the accused after the fashion which is now supposed
to be peculiarly French. The book also
contains records of assessments and payments for
various purposes---poor-relief, the making of
archery-butts, and for "newe Rales and postes
set up about the said Butts," for the fitting out of
soldiers for service in Ireland, and so on. Rents
for houses and gardens, lists of authorized buyers
and sellers in Warwick Market, prices of cattle and
many other varied matters all find record. Mr. Kemp
is to be thanked for a valuable contribution
to local and social history. The book is prettily
got up, but the index might with advantage have
been made fuller. The title-page is not dated.

*Shakespeare's Greenwood*{:.book-title}. By George Morley.
Eight illustrations. London: *David Nutt*, 1900.
Square 16mo., pp. xx, 289. Price 5s. net.
{:.review-abstract}

This is an extremely pretty book. Paper, print,
illustrations, binding---all are charming. It was a
happy thought of Mr. Morley to bring together
notes on the language, superstitions, customs, folklore,
and birds and trees of the beautiful Midland
county for ever associated with the name of
Shakespeare. Many of the words mentioned and
discussed in the section on "Language," are, of
course, not exclusively Midland. Mr. Morley includes
"faggot" among "peculiarly Warwickshire
dialect words of opprobrium;" but the use of
"faggot" in this sense is by no means confined to
Warwickshire, nor, indeed, to the Midland Counties.
The other sections, especially that on "Folk-lore,"
include many ideas which are common in various
parts of the country. Folk, for instance, "tell
the bees" of any important event happening in the
home in both the southern and northern counties
of England, as well as in the Midlands. But such
overlapping is inevitable in any work treating of
the customs and beliefs of a special district. Besides
the sections we have named, the book contains
chapters on "The Parson"---the famous Dr. Samuel Parr;
"The Poets," and "The Novelist."
The last-named is, of course, George Eliot, of
whose connection with the county a very interesting
sketch is given. By the courtesy of the publisher
we are able to reproduce the picture of
Arbury Hall, George Eliot's "Cheverel Manor."
The "Poets" are Somerville, Shenstone, the almost
forgotten Richard Jago, poet of "Edge Hill," and
Lady Luxborough, who wrote pretty lines to Shenstone.
Mr. Morley may be congratulated on producing
a book which is very pleasant to read and
delightful to look at and handle; but why does he
call Warwickshire "leafy" some dozens of times?
Such monotony of epithet becomes tiresome.

*All about the Merry Tales of Gotham*{:.book-title}. By
Alfred Stapleton. With illustrations. Nottingham:
*R. N. Pearson*, 1900. 8vo., pp. 190.

{:.review-abstract}

Mr. Stapleton has chosen a good subject, but has
failed to treat it as it should be treated. The
articles of which the book is composed first
appeared in the pages of a local newspaper, and
are reprinted direct from the linotype castings in
narrow, unattractive-looking columns. Such
course has effectually precluded all adequate
revision and correction, and, what is still more
needed, the complete recasting of the author's
material. But the book must not be taken very
seriously. The author says, very rightly (p. 36)
