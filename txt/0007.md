articles, coarse and poorly fired, but greatly
excelling British work both in potting
and finish. Whether they managed to
spread their superior knowledge we do not
know, but improvement in the pottery of
the country was so slow, and so seldom did
talent and enterprise come to its aid, that
the industry has practically no history until
the thirteenth century. Probably in each
district some man more deft at the work
than his neighbours supplied the local demand
for bowls, porringers, and water-pots,
and such necessary wares, decorating them
according to his own taste and skill.

At the beginning of the thirteenth century
potters, however, were extending their
labours beyond the circumscribed limits of
simple utility. Imagination and ingenuity
were being called into play, as may be seen
from the curious jugs now in Salisbury and
Scarborough Museums and elsewhere, which
take the form of warriors upon horseback.
The result, in this particular case, can
scarcely be justified on the score of artistic
beauty, but it is noteworthy as an indication
of a "forward movement" in the potter's
mind. Until the sixteenth century, the
potter's art was almost entirely confined
to the manufacture of common domestic
vessels, large coarse dishes, cruiskeens,
"tygs," pitchers, bowls, cups, candlesticks,
butterpots, and such articles. Many other
things were, however, imported from the Continent,
and our own potters about this time
began to copy them---a sufficient evidence of
the enterprising spirit gradually growing up
among those who followed the craft.

In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, one
William Simpson proposed to make "in
some decayed town within this realme"
such pots as had been until then imported
from Cologne, by which manufacture he
promised that "many a hundred poore men
should be sette at worke." Whether he was
successful or not we have no record, but
later we find two potters of Norwich, Jasper
Andries and Jacob Janson, claiming to be
"the first that brought in and exercised the
said science in this realm," and petitioning
Queen Elizabeth "because they had so introduced
the science, and been at great
charges before they could find materials in
the country, to grant them house-room in
or without the liberties of London by the
waterside." That at this period English
wares had begun to have some reputation is
probable, for in an inventory of the goods
of a certain Florimond Robertet mention is
made of "fine potteries, the best of Italy,
Germany, Flanders, England, and Spain."

For the first time intermixtures of various
clays were tentatively experimented in, inaugurating
the elaborate mixtures of to-day.
The early potters were content to fashion
their wares of the simple clay that lay near
at hand, and would have been bewildered
by the various ramifications a single piece
of earthenware now goes through before it
reaches completion. On an elaborate piece
of work twenty workmen in turn will now exercise
their art, whilst to produce the painted
bowl the peasant's wife uses to contain the
breakfast of her rustic husband, says Shaw,
"the clays of Dorset and Devonshire,
the flints of Kent, the granite of Cornwall,
the lead of Montgomery, the manganese of
Warwickshire, and the soda of Cheshire
must be conveyed from their respective
districts, and by ingenious processes, the
result of unnumbered experiments, be made
to combine with other substances to form
the artistic or durable whole." To form the
exquisite porcelain of Worcester, at least
seven ingredients have to be blended:
Cornish china, clay and stone, flint from
Dieppe, and calcined bones from America
and various parts of England.

Although one of the least changeable arts
as to constructive methods, pottery has
had extraordinary fluctuations as to locality.
We have but to mention Bow, Chelsea,
Lowestoft, and the New Forest, to show
spots once the scene of busy pot-making
industries, which are now only represented
in museums and private art-collections.
Some places, however, have sustained their
early traditions. Fulham in the fifteenth
century was manufacturing coarse wares and
drain pipes, and of the ware for which it
became famous we have no vessels dated
earlier than the reign of Charles II. In
1671 a patent was taken out by John
Dwight, M.A., of Christ Church, Oxford, for
the "mistery of transparent earthenware commonly
known by the names of Porcelaine
or China and Persian ware, and also the
