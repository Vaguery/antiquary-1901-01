for the discovery is older than history; but
with the art of cookery, pottery followed
as a necessity. The first cook probably
fashioned for his own use the requisite pots
from the material which lay at his feet ---
clumsy clay vessels doubtless, half-baked in
the sun, but sufficiently serviceable.

From earliest times our countrymen have
made various kinds of earthenw^are, though
not always of artistic design or finish. Numer¬ous
specimens of British make have been
found in the barrows or mounds it was their
custom to raise over their dead: dishes,
small vessels for holding incense, and
drinking-cups, made of local clay, with an
admixture of crushed stone to preserve the
shape in firing. In all instances these
distinctive decorations, they managed to
develop quite dissimilar wares. Three most
characteristic kinds of Romano-British pot¬teries
we are able to identify through
existing specimens. The Castor ware, made
at Caistor in Northamptonshire, was a black
ware, ornamented with raised figures, chiefly
hunting scenes, and gladiatorial combats.
Great interest attaches to this pottery, from
the fact that it was the first well-ascer¬tained
discovery of a Roman pot-works, and
at Caistor the first kilns of that period
were uncovered. It is computed that over
2,000 people were employed in the old
Castor pottery. The New Forest, or Crock-
hill, in buff or light reddish brown, was a
ware which continued to be manufactured


primitive pots were formed entirely by the
hand, without the aid of potter's wheel or
lathe, and decorated simply but effectively
by impressing the moist clay with a twisted
cord or the end of a three-sided stick.

The Roman invasion did much for British
pottery. It seems to have been the custom
of the conquerors to establish pot-works
wherever they formed a town or village of
fair size; kilns used by them have been
unearthed throughout the southern and
midland counties, where they made imita¬tions
of the Samian and other noted wares
of Gaul and Italy in local clay. By using
only the clay of the district *with* various

until the fifth century; and, lastly, there was
the Upchurch ware, made out of clay dug
from the marshes at the] mouth of the
Medway. As this ware was always deco¬rated
with dots or bosses, or incised lines
variously arranged, it was easily recognised
and must have achieved some reputation,
since w^e find examples of it scattered
throughout the country and even upon the
Continent. A well-preserved Upchurch
vessel was found among other relics of the
Roman period, in the Roman villa dis¬covered
and laid open a few years ago at
Darenth in Kent.

When the Romans left the country, they
seem to have carried much of the potter's
skill with them, for we find the Anglo-
Saxons so dissatisfied with British produc¬tions
that they sent in haste for their own
potters. These Saxon craftsmen turned
their work upon a wheel, and produced
