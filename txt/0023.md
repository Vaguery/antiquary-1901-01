be most interested in the successive entries
dealing with the appropriation or misappropriation
of the receipts to public and
private uses. The purchase of the book
was coincident with a project for acquiring a
fire-engine, the cost of which was to be
covered by the "market-money." This expensive
undertaking, in which the constables
were to be assisted by two persons specially
chosen by the meeting, left nothing for
ordinary distribution among the respectable
poor; and it seems that the "Tennant of
the Fairs and Markets," Robert Rockett,
was in arrear. As the constables were instructed
to deliver an order to Rockett
requiring him to give an exact account of
receipts and disbursements, the object of the
book is satisfactorily cleared up. However,
the defaulter, though thus "brought to
book," did not pay up immediately. At the
adjourned meeting, held on March 20, the
constables reported that "they nor either of
them have received from Robert Rockett
any account of his receipts and disbursements,
notwithstanding he was served with
an order to do so by one of the said
Constables according to our directions on
the 4<sup>th</sup> of January last." Robert's bold
recalcitrancy caused something of a scandal,
and the indignant goodmen were put to considerable
trouble in getting in that money,
for which trouble Robert was not alone to
blame. Of these proceedings there is a full
report in the book.

The chronicle throws some light on the
state of education in the parish. When
called on to append their signatures some
members of the council were found wanting.
They were compelled to substitute their
marks. Some of these marks are ornate,
others simple; and if we could get to know
something of the persons, it might well be
found that the marks bore a correspondence
to their characters. We should fancy, for
instance, that John Baker, and, in a less
degree, John Bryant, were fond of display,
and that Thomas Eastmond, with his two
marks, was inclined to be avaricious. But
nobody would suspect William Baker, with
his simple stroke, or John Webber, with his
modest circle, either of avarice or display.

The meetings of the goodmen were held
quarterly. They assembled at the market-cross
and immediately adjourned to one of
the inns---the Red Lion or the White Hart.
The distribution of the market-money, when
a surplus remained, to industrious poor
people who kept out of the workhouse, took
place on Sundays after prayer. Public notice
was given in Dulverton Church. On October
28, 1750, it was decided to offer the
"Vickar" thirty shillings as a quarter's
salary for the charity-school master, and
twenty shillings were directed to be paid by
the constables towards fitting up the school.
The Vicar and Mr. Thomas Matthew, the
person chiefly concerned, declined these
amounts, deeming them, no doubt, inadequate.
The spelling of the word "Vicar"
seems to have occasioned the clerk no small
perplexity. A month later he had another
try.

> "1750 November the Vicer (_sic_)
being Ill thare wore no prayers, but about
the usual time at the morning Service ended
the bell was told to give notice to the goodmen
to meet in order to distribute the market
money."

On this occasion "Mary Hole Wid<sup>o</sup>" received
a pound, and William Pile as much
as two pounds ten shillings, while J. Graddon
obtained, as his "wan years Sallery," just a
lawyer's fee. Some of the entries relating to
disbursements are decidedly curious; _e.g._:

|"John Thorn,| | |
|John Allen,| | |
|Edward Graddon,| | |
|Robert Hays at y<sup>e</sup> toll ...|0|4|0
|For Bear for them ...|0|1|0.

It is needless perhaps to explain that they
did not eat "Bear"; they drank it.

Under the date 1752 is appended the
following note:

"The small-pox having been very Hott in
Dulverton was the principal Occasion of the
Decrease of the profits arising by or from
the Markets and Fairs of Dulverton this
year."

As we proceed, we come upon creditor
and debtor accounts on opposite pages,
indicating probably that the trustees, unable
to find an eligible "tenant," ran the fair
themselves. One payment is mysterious.
