and was entombed in the Abbey of Furness
on the day of the Annunciation of the Blessed
Virgin. Forty-six years later the Scots came
into England through the midst of Furness
and the county of Lancaster, laying waste on
all sides, without any damage of their own,
collecting an immense booty of gold and
silver, animals, church ornaments, bedding,
linen, etc.

Canon Routledge reports that the trustees
have begun a systematic excavation of the
recently bought St. Augustine's Abbey Field
site, at Canterbury. The remains of the
early Saxon chapel of St. Pancras have been
uncovered---a pigstye having been disestablished
in the process---and the area excavated
to the floor. The plan, as now completely
revealed, is a valuable addition to the few
early Saxon plans that have been recovered
or have come down to us. Operations on
the site of the great abbey church of St. Peter
and St. Paul, which is known to cover the
sites of two other early Saxon churches---viz.,
that built by King Ethelbert for St. Augustine,
and the Chapel of Our Lady built by
Eadbald---were only tentative, partly on account
of the approach of winter, and partly
owing to the impossibility of removing at
present the huge mass of earth, to the depth
of several feet, which was deposited twenty
years ago on the site of the presbytery.
Despite all hindrances, the north end of the
transept was opened out, with remains of an
apsidal chapel to the east. Certain walls at
the east end of the church have also been
partly unearthed, but the work here is at present
of too fragmentary a character for any
positive statement to be made. Among the
rubbish there were found many gaily painted
stones, together with carved and gilded Purbeck
marble fragments, and bits of porphyry
and serpentine mosaic belonging (no doubt)
to some rich shrine, possibly that of St.
Augustine. Other buildings have been partly
traced, including the chapter-house, which
was over 80 feet long and nearly 40 feet wide,
also walls of a large hall running eastwards,
probably the infirmary.

We hear that the Midhurst District Council
is trying to convert the famous "Close
Walks" at Cowdray, Sussex, which consist of
four avenues of ancient yews, into a sewage
farm. The attempt, for which we cordially
wish complete failure, recalls a curious story
of a fulfilled curse. At the dissolution of
the monasteries. Sir Anthony Browne obtained
a grant of Battle Abbey and the
Priory of Easebourne, the parish in which the
ruins of Cowdray are situate, and according
to a picturesque tradition one of the monks
cursed him to his face, and prophesied that
"by fire and water" his race should perish
out of the land. What foundation there may
be for the story no man can say; but unquestionably
the Brownes did so perish.

At the annual meeting of the Henry Bradshaw
Society, held in November, the membership
and the finances were both stated to be in a
satisfactory condition. Good progress, it was
reported, had been made with the works in
hand, and the volumes for 1900 were nearly
ready for distribution. These will consist of
the first portion of _Directorium Sacerdotum_{:.book-title},
or Sarum _Pica_, edited by Mr. Christopher
Wordsworth, and a volume of _Coronation
Orders_{:.book-title}, edited by Dr. Wickham Legg. The
second part of the _Pica_ will, it is hoped, be
ready for issue in 1901, and a volume of facsimiles
of early _Horæ B.M.V._{:.book-title} is also in an
advanced stage. Among the other works in
preparation, or about to be undertaken, are
an edition of MS. Harl. 2961 (an eleventh-century
English _Collectare_), editions of the
consuetudinaries of St. Augustine's, Canterbury,
