hitherto been given to the fineness of the
clay or to the exact truth of the form into
which it was thrown upon the wheel. The
Elers prepared their clay with extreme care,
and finished with delicacy their favourite
ornaments: the may blossom, the interlacement
of curves, or the bird on wing---
decoration eminently suited to the red ware
they proudly named " Japanese," and which
came so commendably near the productions
of Japan as to be occasionally taken for
them. Besides the red ware they manufactured
a very good Egyptian black, by a mixture
of manganese with the clay, a production
improved upon later by Wedgwood and
others.

Samuel Astbury, a Burslem potter, resolved
to discover the Elers' secret, and
the story runs that he disguised himself,
and, pretending to be half an idiot, obtained
employment at Bradwell Wood. He affected
such ignorance and complete indifference
that gradually he was allowed to watch all
the various processes and to make himself,
unknown to his employers, absolute master
of their art. That done, Astbury threw off
his disguise and entered into open competition
with his former employers, who, in
disgust, removed in 1710 to Lambeth or
Chelsea, where there is at this day a branch
of the family. It is needless to say that
their withdrawal from the district meant no
serious loss to Staffordshire pottery. Their
improvements were neither forgotten nor
disused. The careful grinding of the clays
which they practised, the use of the lathe
and metal stamps, and the process of salt-
glazing, which was undoubtedly introduced
by them, were precious legacies to the district.
Astbury soon modified and enriched their
methods, until he was able to produce a
large variety of cheap and curious wares.

He was almost the earliest scientific
potter, untiring in his experiments, ~and
with a fine habit of observation. This last
quality led him on one occasion to make a
valuable discovery. Travelling to London
in 1720, he halted for the night at Dunstable;
there it was discovered that something
was wrong with one of his horse's
eyes. As a handy remedy the ostler thrust
a flint into the fire, and when it was red-hot
flung it into a basin of water, whereby it was
easily reduced to a fine powder, which he
applied to the injured eye. Astbury watched
the process, and at once shrewdly guessed
that here was the solution of a problem
which had long baffled him. Strong, well-
shapen pottery he had been able to produce,
but its beauty was entirely spoiled by a lack
of purity of colouring. He sent home a
cartload of flints, had them fired and ground
to powder, which he mixed with water and
pipeclay, and washed his dirty-looking wares
in the solution. What was his delight to find
that they came out after the final firing white
and shining, as he had never seen them before
except " in the mind's eye." This discovery
Astbury afterwards improved by introducing
calcined flint into the body of his ware, and
this method soon became universally used
in the Potteries.

Another discovery of great value to ceramic
industry had been made in the South of
England about this time by Cookworthy, a
retired chemist, who found kaolin, a Cornish
china clay, upon the estate of Lord Camel-
ford, and was assisted generously by that
nobleman in an enterprising effort to make
porcelain with it. He opened a pottery at
Plymouth, but success came but slowly, for
Cookworthy was a chemist rather than a
potter, and doubtless it is for his experiments
and the practical results of his chemical
knowledge upon vexed questions in ceramic
work that posterity will remember him.
" His claim upon remembrance," says a
celebrated potter, " is that he conferred the
greatest service upon an industry that one
man can confer: he made workers better
acquainted with their materials." Though
the Plymouth works were opened in 1758,
it was not until ten years later that Cookworthy
obtained a patent " for the exclusive
use of Cornish clay and Cornish growan-
stone in the manufacture of porcelain."
This patent was afterwards sold to Mr.
Champion, of Bristol, who founded a pottery
in that city. Neither the Plymouth nor
Bristol works proved profitable, and in 1877
the patent became the property of a firm in
Staffordshire. This district, which had long
been the cradle of the potter's craft, was
in the eighteenth century to spring to the
position of a great manufacturing and artistic
centre. This evolution, immense and productive
