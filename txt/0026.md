### Publications of Archæological Societies.

The _Transactions of the Glasgow Archæological Society_{:.book-title},
New Series, vol. iv., part i., have reached us.
Archbishop Eyre, the president of the society,
contributes a forcible address, pleading for the
"Preservation of Scottish Ecclesiastical Monuments,"
and also a short paper on "The Seal
of Inchaffray," illustrated by an admirable plate
of the seal. "The Seals of the University of
Glasgow," with an excellent illustrative plate, are
described by Mr. G. W. Campbell. Mrs. Frances Murray
has a curious and most interesting subject,
very quaintly illustrated, in "Painted Wall Cloths
in Sweden," which shows how painted tapestry or
cloths such as were used in these islands in Elizabethan
times---Falstaff speaks of his recruits as
being "as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth"---were
employed by the peasants in some parts of
Sweden as wall-coverings until comparatively recent
days. The other contents of a well printed and
well illustrated part include "Notice of Armour
and Arms at Eglinton Castle, Three Scottish
Swords, etc.," by Mr. R. Brydall; "Note on the
Church of Saint Kentigerna, Inchcailleach, Loch
Lomond," by the Rev. W. H. Macleod; "The Old
Lands of Partick, and the Mill thereof," by Mr. James White;
"Notes on Two Copies of the
Solemn League and Covenant preserved in the
Hunterian Museum of the Glasgow University,"
by Professor Young and Mr. W. I. Addison;
"The Inscriptions on the Distance-Slabs of the
Vallum or Wall of Antoninus Pius," by Dr. James Macdonald;
the fourth supplement to Dr. John Ferguson's
"Bibliographical Notes on Histories
of Inventions and Books of Secrets"; and "The
Old Church of St. Kentigern, Lanark," by Mr. Hugh Davidson.

We have received the _Transactions of the Hull
Scientific and Field Naturalists' Club_{:.book-title} for 1900 (vol. i.,
No. iii.), edited by T. Sheppard, F.G.S., and
J. R. Boyle, F.S.A. Every article, we are glad
to see, refers to matters and subjects of local
interest, and the whole volume testifies to much
good and careful work done by members of the
club. Among the more strictly archæological
contents are Mr. Sheppard's interesting and instructive
study of "Prehistoric Man in Holderness";
the same writer's careful notes on various
bronze weapons and on a Roman vase---all found
in the district; and a facsimile and transcript by
