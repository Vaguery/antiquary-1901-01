across it; that is to say, we have two periods
of construction, just as we have at Birdos-
wald, and as it appears that we have in the
famous bridge across the North Tyne near
Chesters. Further, the rather peculiar posi¬tion
of the fort at Chesters is reproduced in
several other forts on the eastern part of the
Wall, and it is credible that these forts, too,
are reconstructions. There is need of
further excavation before we can argue at
all confidently about these results, but it
may not be rash to say that they appear to
indicate a new phase of the Mural problem.
The old controversy concerned the Vallum,
and centred round such questions as these:
Did Hadrian build the Vallum and Severus
the Wall, or Hadrian both, and Severus
merely repair, or perhaps do nothing at all?
But now the Vallum has been shown, with
some approach to certainty, to be not an
independent work, but connected in some
way with the Wall; and, on the other hand,
the Wall appears now to resolve itself into
two Walls. It may be, after all, equally true
to say that Hadrian built the Wall and that
Severus built it. But time and the spade
will show.

Across the Border the Scotch Society of
Antiquaries has continued its admirable
series of excavations in Roman remains.
This summer it has selected the "camp" at
Lyne, near Peebles, for examination; here
some noteworthy ramparts wear the appear¬ance
of Roman work, and have for many
years been noted as such. The excavations
have confirmed this idea. Excavations have
also been made at the little earthwork called
Kaims Castle, near the Roman road beyond
Ardoch.

HE church at Lostwithiel, Cornwall,
is dedicated to St. Bartholomew,
and the Early English tower is
surmounted by an octagonal
Decorated belfry, having a small gable on
each side. In 1644 the church was de¬stroyed
by the Parliamentarians under Essex.
It appears that certain persons had taken
refuge in the belfry, and gunpowder was
exploded in order to dislodge them. Fortu¬nately
the beautiful fourteenth-century east
window escaped the general ruin. The
curious octagonal font has been fairly well
preserved, and is illustrated in Paley's
*Baptismal Fonts.* The author of this work
informs us that " this is a very singular font
to which it appears difficult to assign a date."
Most likely the font was constructed in the

thirteenth century, although Dr. Lanyon, in
a paper on the ''Cabalistic bas-reliefs" on
this font, places the date as early as the days
of King Arthur. This is far too early a date
to assign to this font, and the ornamentation,
the dress of the knight with his prick-spur,
and the fact that the bowl is octagonal in
shape,'*' all indicate a date not earlier than
the year 1200.

The bowlt has a geometrical patternj
carved round the drain, and is supported on
