Brown got eight shillings. John Cruse was
the recipient of just sixpence less, which
sum was paid him "for Conveying John
Allen to Bridewell." Turning to the receipts,
we meet with entries which may strike a
stranger as mysterious, but present no
difficulty whatever to anyone versed in the
local dialect. There are, for instance, constant
allusions to "pinding" sheep. For
thus treating forty quadrupeds a certain John Ansty
ought to have had eightpence. This
is a good example of phonetic spelling. The
Dulverton pronunciation of "pen" was, and
is, "pine," but the Dulverton man is uncertain
in his "d's." Thus, he will say
"taildor" for "tailor," and "cornder" for
"corner." This is most observable when a
vowel follows. So it is that while he pronounces
"pen" "pine," he contrives to slip
in a "d" in the participial form. And this
usage is reflected in the book. The work
naturally refers to numerous standings, for
two of which John Chilcott paid thirteen
shillings and fourpence. Perversely enough
the Dulverton man drops his "d" in this
case, and says "stannins." This time, however,
the book must escape censure. "Two
shillings" was the sum disbursed "for carrying
in the hurdles after the fair." A funeral
ceremony this, but fairs cannot last for ever,
and it is well when they come round in due
season. It grieves me to state that this can
no longer be predicated of Dulverton Fair.
It is a good many years now since the
hurdles were carried in for the last time
owing to various circumstances, of which
presently.

In the palmy days of the fair there was no
lack of fun. The writer has seen a gold-laced
hat subscribed for by a party of festive
gentlemen at the White Hart and worn by
one of the officials named Rowland, who was
also town-crier, and head shoemaker, as
insignia. That, at any rate, is the tale as
it was told to me some two years ago, but
more recent investigation has brought in a
flood of destructive criticism. The son of
the last lessee, Mr. W. Hawkins, has never
beheld the "chimney-pot," and thinks it very
doubtful whether it ever was "sported" in
the manner alleged. Here is a question
which the Dulverton people may be left to
fight out amongst themselves. Meanwhile,
it will not be amiss to relate Mr. Hawkins'
version of the dying of the old fair, since it
is likely, from the nature of things, to be
more correct than any obtainable elsewhere.

Mr. Hawkins senior had rented the fair for
a long term, and with excellent results. One
year the proceeds of the summer fair sufficed
to cover the rent, the tolls of the winter fair
and the two markets being clear gain. Then
in the sixties came the rinderpest, and brought
everything to a standstill. When the plague
had been stamped out an attempt was made
to restart, but in vain. Mr. Hawkins was
just at the beginning of a second long lease,
but, under the changed conditions, not unnaturally
repented of his bargain. Finding
that the production of the hurdles had ceased
to work its customary spell, he sent his son
to the trustees with a quarter's rent, and
declined further responsibility. Upon this
the trustees endeavoured, with Rowland's
assistance, to manage the fair themselves.
This, as we have seen, was not a novel
experiment, but it did not answer. No
doubt the institution of a monthly market at
Brushford, only two miles distant, told with
disastrous effect on the fair, which had no
special attractions to save it from the fate of
fairs in general. As, however, the charter
required that the Dulverton fairs and markets
should not interfere with those of the neighbouring
places, some of the old inhabitants
want to know why a modern market was
allowed to extinguish the venerable fixtures
in which they took pride. On the whole,
however, the townsmen show themselves
resigned, and indeed merry, for in the annals
of Dulverton it is recorded that on a certain
fair-day a pen was found in the Fore Street,
and in the pen a lamb. Alas, poor Yorick!

### Gogarth Abbey, Llandudno.

By **W. H. Burnett**{:.author-name}.
{:.byline}

On a shelving tract of land on a
portion of the otherwise precipitous
Great Orme's Head, and
fronting towards Penmanmawr, the
Conway estuary, and Puffin Island, there are
the remains of what is popularly designated
