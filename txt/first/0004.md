Driffield, in Yorkshire, is fortunate beyond
most towns of its size in the possession of a
well-equipped museum of archaeology and
geology, which contains the extensive collec¬tions
made by Mr. J. R. Mortimer. The

Yorkshire Wolds used to be one of the most
fruitful collecting grounds for prehistoric

relics in England, and Mr. Mortimer obtained
large numbers of specimens of flint and stone
implements with comparative ease, where
now, so often has the ground been gone
over, it is difficult to obtain a few good
examples. More important are the many
skeletons, with the vases and objects of
stone, bronze, bone, jet, etc., which have
been obtained from the numerous barrows,
the opening of which has been Mr. Morti¬mer's
hobby during a period of some forty
years. He has examined more than 300,
and the Driffield Museum has been greatly en¬riched
by his labours. The first illustration
on this page shows a very fine bronze dagger or
knife, with a bone pummel, obtained from a
barrow at Garton Slack. The handle con¬tains
over forty bronze rivets. Our second
illustration shows a food vase, finely orna¬mented,
found in a barrow at Fimber.

The museum, besides an abundance of
such relics of early Britain, contains many
Danish and American antiquities, Roman
and Romano-British pottery and other re¬mains,
and an extensive geological section.
A fully illustrated and very carefully com¬piled
catalogue of the contents of the Morti¬mer
Museum, by Mr. T. Sheppard, F.G.S.,
to whose courtesy we are indebted for the
use of the two blocks, has lately been issued
by Messrs. A. Brown and Sons, Limited, of
Hull, and of 5, Farringdon Avenue, London,
E.G., at the very moderate price of is. net.
