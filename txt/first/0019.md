characteristic utterance of Cromwell's per¬ception:
' ' One partial glimpse into the root of the matter
he unmistakably had. 'These poor people,' he
said (December, 1649), 'have been accustomed to
as much injustice, tyranny, and oppression from
their landlords, the great men, and those who
should have done them right, as any people in
that which we call Christendom. Sir, if justice
were freely and impartially administered here, the
foregoing darkness and corruption would make it
look so much the more glorious and beautiful, and
draw more hearts after it.' This was Oliver's
single glimpse of the main secret of the everlasting
Irish question; it came to nothing, and no other
English ruler had even so much as this for many
generations afterwards."

Many readers will feel the charm of the
aphorisms with which Mr. Morley, Hke a
new Tacitus, distinguishes the pages of his
history. We venture to cull a few:

" We go wrong in political judgment if we leave
out rivalries, heart-burnings, personalities, even
among leading men and great men

or again:

" Nothing in all the known world of politics is so
intractable as a band of zealots conscious that they
are a minority, yet armed by accident with the
powers of a majority ";

or:

"It is not always palatable for men in power to
be confronted with their aims in opposition

and this of Charles I., that he

" was the royal egotist without the mask."

Upon Cromwell himself Mr. Morley passes
the careful phrases of this judgment:

"In our own half-century now closing, alike in
Western Europe and across the Atlantic, the torch
of war has been lighted rather for unity of race or
State than for liberty. Cromwell struck for both.
It was his armed right hand that crushed the abso¬lutist
pretensions alike of crown and mitre, and
then forced the three kingdoms into the mould of a
single Sta^te. It was at those decisive moments
when the trembling balance hung on fortune in the
battlefield that the unconquerable captain turned
the scale. After we have discussed all the minor
aspects of his special policies on this occasion or
the other, after we have scanned all the secondary
features of this rule, this is still what, in a single
sentence, defines the true place of Cromwell in our
history. ' '

III. **Mr. Roosevelt's "Cromwell."**{.scaps}

Mr. Roosevelt is an American who touches
Ufe at many points. He has travelled far and

written much. He saw military service in
Cuba, and is Governor of New York State
and Vice-President-elect of the Republic. His
book on Cromwell is a clever piece of work,
and has some novel features. We may con¬gratulate
him on two things: firstly, the "make¬up
of, and illustrations to, his volume; and,
secondly, the discovery of something really
new in the treatment of Cromwell and his
times. The portraits and scenes are as w^ell
reproduced as "process'' allows; of the former
the little-known "early" portrait of Oliver from
Hinchingbrooke, and those of Strafford and
Hampden, from Devonshire House and Port
Eliot respectively, are especially notable;
and of the views drawn for this publication,
we like the simple sketch of Cromwell's
simple house at Ely, and the lugubrious
little pictures of Drogheda. Certain docu¬ments
and seals make illustrations of a
very proper kind. But, apart from the re¬telling
of matter which, as we have said, is
necessarily common to all these books, this
author has found something new to impress
upon his readers; and it really is a striking
analogy. He finds close analogues for Crom¬well,
his leaders and the Puritans in the
modern history of his own country. He
compares Stonewall Jackson with Ireton,
Washington with Hampden, and Lincoln
with Cromwell --- the last in a passage
(at p. 208) well worth the reader's close
attention. He finds real grounds for com¬paring
the two stages of history in the
matters of religious toleration (p. 23), of war
(p. 62), and of military affairs in points of
detail (pp. 65, 70). He even compares the
tea thrown into Boston Harbour with the
Ship-money incident. It may be said that
there is room for self-deception in pushing
these analogues too far; but Mr. Roosevelt
is as cautious as he is instructive in his
instances of what is really meant by the
repetitions of history. We observe, too, that
in several passages (as at pp. 67, 144 and
165) he discerns a Hkeness between the
Boers fighting for their republics and the
Puritans fighting for the freedom of their
own State; nor is the likeness, in many
respects, to be denied. One other charac¬teristic
of Mr. Roosevelt's work, which, as a
whole, lacks both the thoroughness of
Mr. Firth's history and the sageness of
