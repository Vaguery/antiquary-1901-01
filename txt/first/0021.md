at Dulverton enabled the writer to furnish
this magazine with a paper entitled " A
Sacristan's Commonplace Book." It may be
added that the scenery is as varied as it is
dehghtful, wild moorland alternating with
beautiful woods and green pastures.

We first hear of Dulverton Fair in the
thirty-fourth year of the first Edward, which

Shete, who, it is evident, held the key to the
position. Hawisia was thrice married, and
William was her third husband. Of her
first consort, Thomas de Pyn, it is recorded
that " he took and restrained all waifs and
strays that came on his lands, but by what
warrant or ancient custom, the jury knew

1340 led to the declaration that he had given
