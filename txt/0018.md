Having dwelt on this particular use of his
work, we must not do Mr. Firth the injustice
of ignoring wider claims to praise. Out of
his fund of original and detailed research he
has produced other than military judgments.
For example, he endorses the observation of
a friend who, having known Cromwell's
earlier manhood, remarked, many years
later, that the turning-point in his spiritual
life coincided with the turning-point in the
history of the Puritan cause, and so "he
suffered and rose with the cause, as if he
had one life with it." But without entering
further into this important matter, we may
insist on the convincing and illuminating
estimate of Cromwell's military prowess. In
his epilogue Mr. Firth describes his natural
aptitude for war, his success as a leader of
cavalry, his management of the battle-field,
and the sure boldness of his strategy. The
secret is perhaps explained in this passage:

> "Officers, it has been well said, are the soul of an
army; and the efficiency and good conduct which
Cromwell required of his, they exacted from the
rank and file.... A common spirit bound men
and officers together. It was their pride that they
were not a mere mercenary army, but men who
fought for principles as well as for pay. Cromwell
succeeded in inspiring them not only with implicit
confidence in his leadership, but with something of
his own high enthusiasm. He had the power of
influencing masses of men which Napoleon
possessed. So he made an army on which, as
Clarendon said, 'victory seemed entailed.'"

### II. Mr. Morley's "Cromwell."

Like Mr. Roosevelt's, Mr. Morley's book
first appeared serially in one of the leading
American magazines. The copy of the
volume before us, while it contains a good
reproduction of the famous portrait at Sidney
Sussex College, Cambridge, has not the
numerous illustrations which we noticed in
the *Century Magazine*{:.book-title}. In its features and
general contour Mr. Morley's portrait naturally
resembles that of Mr. Firth; but the
spirit of the artist is different, as is easily to
be discerned. Indeed, it was natural to
expect that Mr. Morley would treat his
subject not so much with the industry of
the history-craftsman as in the mood of the
sage, seeking measure, equity, and balance
besides praise and blame. For this reason,
as also was to be expected, Mr. Morley's
volume is an addition to political literature
which will endure. His elaborate appreciation
of the great forerunner, in the world of
action, of Rousseau and those other creators
of the French Revolution, whom Mr. Morley
"knows" so well, is impartial indeed. The
work is a high example of that saying of
Seeley, that

> "politics are vulgar when they are not liberalized
by history, and history fades into mere literature
when it loses sight of its relation to practical
politics."

As Mr. Morley himself says:

> "The first act of the revolutionary play cannot be
understood until the curtain has fallen on the fifth.
> 
> ...Only time tells all.... So history makes the
shifting things seem fixed. Posterity sees a whole."

Thus Mr. Morley, writing two and a half
centuries later down the course of posterity,
is able more clearly than could a Clarendon
to see the meaning of Cromwell's career. He
is able at one and the same time to admit
that, in many respects, Cromwell was before
his time, and to do justice with a nice
enthusiasm to "his free and spacious genius,
his high heart, his singleness of mind." Both
critics and admirers of Mr. Morley's political
attitude will turn with interest to see how he
estimates the hero's work in Ireland. Mr.
Morley is a stern and merciless judge. If
we may be permitted at one point to check
the evidence on which he relies, it is only
fair to complete the quotation given at
p. 304 from Cromwell's own challenge to
produce "an instance of one man since my
coming to Ireland, not in arms, massacred,
destroyed, or banished." Mr. Morley omits
the words which follow: "concerning the
massacre or destruction of whom justice
hath not been done or endeavoured to be
done."[^fn] But, upon the whole, who soberly
can dispute his judgment that it is perfectly

> "intelligible how his name has come to be hated in
the tenacious heart of Ireland. What is called his
settlement aggravated Irish misery to a degree that
cannot be measured, and before the end of a single
generation events at Limerick and the Boyne showed
how hollow and ineffectual, as well as how mischievous,
the Cromwellian settlement had been."

(1870), ii. 254; Gardiner, *History*{:.book-title} (1649--60), i.
138 n.

But Mr. Morley closes his sorrowful chapter
on the settlement with this tribute to a
