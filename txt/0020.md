Mr. Morley's appreciation, is, indeed, the
brilliant little pen-portraits of personalities.
We have (at p. lo) such a picture of Eliza¬beth,
followed by a very shrewd contrast
between the sagacities of the Tudor and the
Stuart despots. There is this of Charles I.:

"In private life he was the best of the Stuart
Kings, reaching above the average level of his
subjects. In public life his treachery, mendacity,
folly and vindictiveness; his utter inability to learn
by experience, or to sympathize with any noble
ambition of his country; his readiness to follow
evil counsel, and his ingratitude towards any sin¬cere
friend, made him as unfit as either of his sons
to sit on the English throne, and a greater con¬demnation
than this it is not possible to award."

Mr. Roosevelt is probably right in saying
that the greatest confidence of the Stuarts
rested in " the wise distrust of radical innova¬tion
and preference for reform to revolution
which gives to the English race its greatest
strength.'' But he shows, in his picturesque
narrative, how the exception proved the rule.
We may leave his book with one other quota¬tion
which is a good example of this American
writer's suggestive and original style:

"From the dreamers of dreams, of whose
'cloistered virtue' Milton spoke with such fine
contempt, the men who possessed, the capacity to
do things turned contemptuously away, seeking
practical results rather than theoretical perfection,
and being content to get the substance at some cost
of form. As always, the men who counted were
those who strove .for actual achievement in the field
of practical politics, and who were not misled
merely by names. England, in the present century,
has shown how complete may be the freedom of
the individual under a nominal monarchy; and the
Dreyfus incident in France would be proof enough,
were any needed, that despotism of a peculiarly
revolting type may grow rankly, even in a republic,
if there is not in its citizens a firm and lofty pur¬pose
to do justice to all men, and guard the rights
of the weak as well as of the strong. ' '

Such are some of the characteristics of
three sound and luminous additions to the
literature of Cromwell. Each one in its own
way should enhancd the greatness of their
hero, and induce citizens of the Anglo-Saxon
world to revert, in some measure, to the
great type which they display. The present
writer, proud to number himself among the
many who in great or slight degree claim
kinship with the family of the Great Pro¬tector,
by chance discovered lately in the
register of a Warwickshire church a tirade
by a Rector of 1716 against "those Rapacious
Vermin," the officers and troops of Cromwell!
We see things now in a better proportion,
and he who, in approaching the Houses of
our Parliament, is moved to salute the bronze
effigy of the great Oliver, securely approves
Carlyle's great eulogy:

"This action of English Regicides did in effect
strike a damp like death through the heart of
Flunkyism universally in this world. Whereof
Flunkyism, Cant, Cloth-Worship, or whatever ugly
name it have, has gone about incurably sick ever
since; and is now at length, in these generations,
very rapidly dying. The like of which action
will not be needed for a thousand years again. . . .
Thus ends the Second Civil War. In Regicide,
in a commonwealth, and keepers of the Liber¬ties
of England. In punishment of delinquents;
in abolition of Cobwebs---if it be possible in a
Government of Heroism and Veracity; at lowest
of anti-Flunkyism,---anti-Cant, and the endeavour
after Heroism and Veracity."

EW towns of its size can boast of
greater celebrity or richer attrac¬tions
than Dulverton, in West
Somerset. It is only by courtesy
a town. Really, it is a pretty village, rather
larger than the run of villages in that part
of the world, distributed into streets, fore¬shadowed
by a suburb, and a sort of capital
for the smaller villages and hamlets round
about; but, tested by area and population,
not a town, a description to which it lays
claim by virtue of ancient usage and local
considerations of the kind indicated. Never¬theless,
for others than those whose lot has
been cast in the vicinity, Dulverton is a place
of importance. When we have said that it
is an established haunt of the cosmopolitan
fly-fisher, and a handy and customary base
for stag-hunters, it will be conceded by all
persons qualified to judge that Dulverton,
little though it be, is not a quantity to be
neglected. For the antiquary, too, the spot
has many charms. With regard to these, a
few hints are afforded in a small handbook.
